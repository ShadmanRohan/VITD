## Setup
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Install package: `pip install -e .`

## Model Checkpoints
The model checkpoints are not stored in this repository due to their size. You can:
- Download pretrained models from [HuggingFace Hub](https://huggingface.co/models) (add specific model links)
- Access our fine-tuned checkpoints from [Google Drive/Other Storage] (add link)
